  EndingText: Tick-tock. As the countdown slowly ticked away, he took a breath. That
    big, red, and shiny button had to stop the destruction! He rushed to the button
    and pressed it. One last tick, and the countdown was stopped. He was the one
    who had rescued this starship; he was the hero!
